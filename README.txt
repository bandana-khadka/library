<Coding style rules>

•	Comments
1.	TODOs should include the string TODO in all caps, followed by the name, e-mail address, or other identifier of the person who can best provide context about the problem referenced by the TODO, in parentheses. A comment explaining what there is to do is required.
2.	Have a comment on every function that describes its purpose.

•	Naming
1.	Use CapWords for class names, but lower_with_under.py for module names.
2.	Use of underscores in names, not using any dashes.
3.	Not using any single character names except for counters and iterators.
4.	Prepending a single underscore (_) has some support for protecting module variables and functions (not included with import * from). 
5.	Prepending a double underscore (__) to an instance variable or method effectively serves to make the variable or method private to its class (using name mangling).
6.	Don't abbreviate local variables (e.g., 'total' not 'tot')

•	Statements
	Only one statement in a line.

•	Imports Formatting
Imports should be on separate lines.

•	WhiteSpacing
1.	No whitespace inside parentheses, brackets or braces.
2.	No whitespace before a comma, semicolon, or colon. Do use whitespace after a comma, semicolon, or colon except at the end of the line.
3.	No whitespace before the open paren/bracket that starts an argument list, indexing or slicing.
 
•	Python Style Rules
1.	Do not terminate your lines with semi-colons and do not use semi-colons to put two commands on the same line.
2.	Indent your code blocks with 4 spaces.
3.	Two blank lines between top-level definitions, one blank line between method definitions.
